# About
Hello, I'm Ebraheem Ahmed, a full-stack developer with 2+ years of experience in freelance back-end development. I've built web applications for startups and mid-level agencies, specializing in end-to-end solutions. My Computer Science degree from Tanta University provided a strong foundation, but Iâ€™ve focused my expertise on full-stack development.
